# For The Odin Project - Project: Recipes
This project is a part of "The Odin Project" curriculum. It is a multi-page site that contains some cooking recipes. 
<br /><br />
To create it, I used:
<ul>
<li>HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JS.</li>
<li>GitHub pages for hosting.</li>
</ul>
The final working result you can find here: <a href="https://viktoriia-yash.github.io/odin-recipes/">link</a>.
