        <h4>What Is Shrimp Scampi</h4>
        <p>
          Shrimp scampi is a seafood dish made of shrimp cooked in a butter,
          garlic, and white wine sauce. You can serve shrimp scampi by itself as
          an appetizer or over pasta as a main dish.
        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients for Shrimp Scampi with Pasta</h4>
        <h5>Shrimp</h5>
        <p>
          Choose large shrimp (31 to 35 shrimp per pound) to get best results
          for this recipe. You can buy fresh shrimp and peel and devein it
          yourself, or buy frozen shrimp. Thaw frozen shrimp before using.
        </p>
        <h5>Pasta</h5>
        <p>
          This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine, but you can
          substitute the pasta of your choice, like angel hair pasta,
          fettuccine, or spaghetti.
        </p>
        <h5>Butter</h5>
        <p>
          Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.
        </p>
        <h5>Extra-virgin olive oil</h5>
        <p>
          The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this recipe, so use the
          best quality.
        </p>
        <h5>Shallots and garlic</h5>
        <p>These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp scampi.</p>
        <h5>White wine</h5>
        <p>
          Use a dry, crisp white wine for shrimp scampi sauce. Pinot grigio or
          sauvignon blanc are good choices, and you can drink the leftover wine
          with dinner.
        </p>
        <h5>Lemon juice</h5>
        <p>Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.</p>
        <h5>Seasonings</h5>
        <p>
          Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper amplify the flavors, and a
          pinch of dried red pepper flakes give shrimp scampi a subtle kick. Use
          more red pepper flakes if you like things a bit more spicy.

        <h4>How to Make Shrimp Scampi Pasta</h4>
        <p>
          The full recipe directions are below, but here are top tips for recipe
          success:
        </p>
        <h5>Prep ahead</h5>
        <p>
          Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready to cook before heating
          your skillet. You don't want to have to pause to cut, chop, squeeze,
          or measure right in the middle of a fast-moving recipe. If you use
          fresh shrimp, you can peel and devein the shrimp earlier in the day,
          then keep it chilled in the refrigerator until you're ready to get
          cooking.
        </p>
        <h5>Cook the pasta first</h5>
        <p>
          Boil the pasta in well-salted water, drain, and hold aside before
          cooking the shrimp scampi. You'll add the pasta to the hot skillet to
          warm it before serving. Time your cooking so you're ready to start
          cooking the shrimp immediately after the pasta is drained; you don't
          want the pasta to sit for too long.
        </p>
        <h5>Don't overcook the shrimp</h5>
        <p>
          It takes just a couple of minutes to cook raw shrimp, and if they cook
          for too long, shrimp turn tough and rubbery. You'll know the shrimp
          are close to done when they start to curl into a C shape and turn from
          translucent gray to opaque pink and white.
        </p>
        <h5>Bonus tip</h5>
        <p>
          Before you drain the pasta, hold aside a half cup of the pasta water
          to add to the sauce if the finished dish looks a little dry (you may
          not have to add the entire half cup). Pasta water is a pasta cook's
          secret weapon. The starchy water adds extra flavor and moistness to
          the recipe, gives sauces a smoother texture, and helps bind the sauce
          to the pasta

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

          2 cloves garlic, minced<br />
          1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional)<br />
          1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined<br />
          1 pinch kosher salt and freshly ground pepper<br />
          ½ cup dry white wine<br />
          1 lemon, juiced<br />
          2 tablespoons butter<br />
          2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil<br />
          ¼ cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves<br />
          1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste<br />
        </p>

      <div class="directions">
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
        <p>
          Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; cook linguine in boiling
          water until nearly tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
        <p>
          Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large
          skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir shallots, garlic, and red
          pepper flakes in the hot butter and oil until shallots are
          translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Season shrimp with kosher salt and black
          pepper; add to the skillet and cook until pink, stirring occasionally,
          2 to 3 minutes. Remove shrimp from skillet and keep warm.
        </p>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
        <p>
          Pour white wine and lemon juice into skillet and bring to a boil while
          scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet
          with a wooden spoon. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in skillet, stir 2
          tablespoons olive oil into butter mixture, and bring to a simmer. Toss
          linguine, shrimp, and parsley in the butter mixture until coated;
          season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil
          to serve.
